COPADS (Collection of Python Algorithms and Data Structures).

The main aim of COPADS is to develop a compilation of of Python data 
structures and its algorithms, making it almost a purely developmental 
project. Personally, I look at this as a re-usable collection of tools 
that I can use in other projects. Therefore, this project is essentially 
"needs-driven", except a core subset of data structures and algorithms. 

This project originated from 3 threads of thought. Firstly, while browsing 
through Mehta and Sahni's Handbook of Data Structures and Applications, I 
thought there might be utility to have a number of the listed data 
structures implemented in Python. Given my interest in biological data 
management, having a good set of data structures is always handy. The 2nd 
thread of thought came from Numerical Recipes. Again, I thought these 
algorithms will be handy to have and had started to translate some of 
them into Python during some overly energetic days. Finally, Python 
Cookbook had undergone 2 editions by 2008 and ActiveState had provided an 
online platform for Python Recipes which I found to be useful and can see 
how some of these recipes can be merged. Thus, COPADS is borned.
