    Representation of a 3-dimensional ecological world.
    
    The ecosystem is made up of ecological cells. Each ecological cell is
    modelled as a dictionary of 
        - local_input: A list containing processed input, representing 
          the partial local ecological condition, to be used as input to 
          the organisms in the current ecological cell. This is updated 
          by World.update_local function.
        - local_output: A list containing processed output, representing 
          the partial local ecological condition. This is updated by 
          World.update_local function.
        - temporary_input: A list acting as temporary holding for input 
          after being fed to the organisms in the current ecological 
          cell, which is to be used to update local_input and local_output 
          lists by World.update_local and World.update_ecology functions.
        - temporary_output: A list acting as temporary holding for output 
          from the organisms in the current ecological cell, which is to 
          be used to update local_input and local_output lists by 
          World.update_local and World.update_ecology functions.
        - organisms: The number of organisms in the current ecological 
          cell which is updated by World.organism_movement and 
          World.organism_location functions.
